            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My Name is Divin Gregis Baniekona. I'm an IT consultant. 
              I've been passionate in IT sine I was a kid. In the early 90's when as a kid I used to work during the summer vacations at my father's computer shop. 
              <br>I grew up in the Republic of Congo.</p>
            <p>Years later in 2000 when I graduated from high school I decided to pursue an Associate Degree in Networking. <br>I've been in different roles since including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Help Desk.</li>
                <li>Network Support Engineer.</li>
                <li>Server administration</li>
                <li>ATM Installation, configuration and Support</li>
                <li>Level 3 IT Support</li>
                <li>Cloud Architect</li>
                <li>Cloud Security Engineer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I enjoy working in dynamic and motivated teams on IT projects from the beginning to the end. Later onI would like to be an Entrepreneur in the IT field. <br>Because I enjoy working on multiple fields related to IT, I plan to launch a worldwide Technology Provider company. </p>
